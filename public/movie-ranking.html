<h1> The Best Movies According to D'Angelo</h1>
<h2> My top Movies of All Time </h2>
<hr />
<h3> Everything Everywhere All at Once </h3>
<p> At surface level, it looks like a mundane silly movie, but what I love the most about is the optimistic nihilism message that it carries deep down. </p>
<h3> The Pursuit of Happiness </h3>
<p> Life will beat you down, it will do it again, and again, and again. Yet, despite that we must keep standing up again, and again because eventually, we will strike back. </p>
<h3> Hustle </h3>
<p> Adam Sandler at his best, a film that takes the blind fold off of your eyes and makes you remember that hard work beats talent, every time.</p>
